    <p>I used Python and a Software Defined Radio to program a streaming FM radio player that uses a speech-to-text model to produce live captions as it plays.
    Through this project I learned a variety of signal processing and asynchronous programming techniques,
    and I wrote an extensive report outlining my findings. Check it out!</p>

    <p>Rocketry is all about intentional design and data-driven iteration. In the 2020 season, I led a TARC team that emphasized these tenets.
    Although the main competition was cancelled because of the pandemic, I immediately signed my team up for the virtual presentation competition for a chance to present our hard work over the year.
    After a slides review and a virtual conference, our presentation won First Place because of our analytical approach and professional delivery.</p>
