## Study Experience

Since this was a *study* abroad, I feel obliged to touch on my actual studies. I took three courses at ETH: Computer Architecture, Concepts of OOP (COOP), and Applied Glaciology.
I chose Comparch because I felt that my low-level computing knowledge was lacking, COOP because I enjoyed the programming languages course at UW the previous year, and Glaciology because it sounded fun and there was a field trip attached.
Another factor was timing -- most courses at ETH have exams in mid January through February, called the "exam session", but I wanted to be done earlier, so I picked these three courses which finished before the holidays.

I enjoyed the content in each of the classes, and the lectures for COOP were especially engaging.
COOP's course structure was a huge adjustment to me, though -- while at UW our CSE courses almost always have significant graded homework portions, at ETH it's common to have 100% of the grade based on a final exam (80%) and a midterm (20%).
On top of that, the exams are designed to be incredibly difficult, such that getting 40-50% of the points would be a pass.
This made the final exam quite stressful (particularly because I had two days to study for it after some friends visited me) but I ended up passing with a decent margin.

Because of all my traveling, I spent a lot of my time in Zurich frantically paying down all the coursework debt I'd accumulated.
This was especially the case for Comparch, which had 5 written homeworks and 4 in-depth labs in a more UW-style course setup.
I spent the most time on this course by far with a total of 136 hours, 27 of which were for Lab 1 alone.

I took Glaciology mostly for fun, and it definitely lived up to that intent.
I convinced a bunch of my friends to join the class, and even though lectures were at 8:30am we showed up in solidarity (most of the time).
It was cool to experience this class in Switzerland, which has one of the most extensive repositories of historical glacier movement and other environmental data which we used in our assignments.

On top of the coursework, though, the field trip to Jungfraujoch was absolutely amazing[^1].
Visiting the popular tourist location with the class, we got to tour secret areas like the researchers' house, science laboratory, and an ice tunnel underneath the glacier, and our professor told us stories about the history of the research station and construction of the highest railroad in Europe.
