I'm from Seattle and now live in New York City since June 2025.

I graduated in 2025 from the BS/MS computer science program at the University of Washington.
In Fall 2023, I lived in Switzerland for a few months while doing an exchange semester at ETH Zurich,
where I had a great time traveling around Europe and taking classes.
