I am a BS/MS computer science student and NASA Space Grant scholar at the University of Washington.
In Fall 2023, I went for an exchange semester at ETH Zurich, where I took classes on programming languages and computer architecture and traveled around Europe.

I have two papers accepted to NeurIPS 2024! Check out [WildGuard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18495){:target="_blank"} and [WildTeaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18510){:target="_blank"} for works on LLM jailbreaking, safety, and guardrails.

In the summer of 2024, I interned at [Databricks](https://databricks.com){:target="_blank"} for software engineering.
Before that during summer 2023, I was an intern in [Stripe](https://stripe.com){:target="_blank"}'s risk organization, improving tools for risk analysts to investigate suspicious merchants on the platform.
From 2020 to 2022, I worked as a software engineering intern at [Conversica](https://conversica.com){:target="_blank"}, where I built platforms powering AI model operations, including natural language understanding and generation.

Some of my hobbies are rock climbing,
reading ([follow me on Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/kavelrao){:target="_blank"}),
and hiking ([read my WTA trip reports](https://www.wta.org/@@backpacks/scrnm-kavellier){:target="_blank"}).
