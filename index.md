I am an undergraduate computer science student and NASA Space Grant scholar at the University of Washington.
My interests are in using software and AI to further social good, and I'm always exploring to find more areas and applications that call to me!

I'm currently conducting research with [Liwei Jiang](https://liweijiang.me/){:target="_blank"} in [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/){:target="_blank"}'s group at the intersection of natural language processing, explainable AI, and ethics/social good.

For over a year starting in the summer of 2021, I worked as a software engineering intern at [Conversica](https://conversica.com){:target="_blank"}, where I built platforms powering AI model operations, including natural language understanding and generation.

Some of my hobbies are rock climbing,
reading ([follow me on Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/kavelrao){:target="_blank"}),
and hiking ([read my WTA trip reports](https://www.wta.org/@@backpacks/scrnm-kavellier){:target="_blank"}).
