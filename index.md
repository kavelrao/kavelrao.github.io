<p class="describe-text">Hi, welcome to my personal website!</p>

I'm an undergraduate computer science student passionate about using software in conversational AI and social good applications. \\
I conduct research with [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/) and [Liwei Jiang](https://liweijiang.me/) at the intersection of natural language processing, explainable AI, and ethics/social good. \\
I currently work in an internship at Conversica, where I'm building platforms that support our natural language understanding and generation AI model operations. I'm also a scholar of the NASA Space Grant Consortium at the University of Washington.

Take a look at my [projects](/projects), [github](github.com/kavelrao) or [r&eacute;sum&eacute;](/assets/files/resume.pdf)! \\
You can email me at kavelrao@cs.uw.edu :)
